      <dd>
        A modern tech stack has many more components, because of the increase in
        the number of devices from which users can access applications and the
        huge volumes of events and data processing. It might include tools for
        containerization, performance monitoring, business intelligence, event
        processing, data lakes, cloud services, microservices, and analytics.
        You should choose the technology stack you want to use based on your
        project needs and other factors, which we will discuss later in this
        article.

      <dt style="font-weight: 800">What is an example of a tech stack?</dt>
      <dd>
        One of the most popular and easiest examples of a technology stack is
        the MEAN stack. MEAN stands for MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node.js. You can
        replace Angular and use React, as in the MERN stack, since React is
        becoming equally popular, especially for single page web applications.
      </dd>
      <dt style="font-weight: 800">Frontend tech stack</dt>
      <dd>
        For most of the web applications, the choice of frontend remains
        similar. Modern web applications are based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        TypeScript, or frameworks based on JS, like React, Vue, and Express.
      </dd>
      <dt style="font-weight: 800">HTML</dt>
      <dd>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) defines the basic layout and structure
        of your pages. For example, the sections, bulleted points, and tables
        are created using HTML tags.
      </dd>
      <dt style="font-weight: 800">CSS</dt>
      <dd>
        All the styling that’s applied to the web pages comes from CSS—for
        example, the green theme of the MongoDB pages.
      </dd>
      <dt style="font-weight: 800">JavaScript</dt>
      <dd>
        The dynamic elements of the page come from the JavaScript code written
        by developers. For example, what happens when you hover your mouse over
        an image, or when you click on a submit, like, or comment button is
        decided by JavaScript events in the code. There are many other
        frameworks and libraries—like Bootstrap, Vue, React, Angular, and
        jQuery—that are built on JavaScript and provide additional
        functionalities and common use cases, making a developer’s life much
        easier.
      </dd>
      <dt style="font-weight: 800">Back End tech Stack</dt>
      <dd>
        The backend or server-side tech stack consists of many components, like
        database, server, framework, and operating system. You have to choose
        the server-side frameworks and tools carefully, because some
        technologies are lightweight, fast, and suitable for basic purposes,
        whereas some are loaded with features that only a complex application
        might need.
      </dd>
      <dt style="font-weight: 800">Full Stack tech Stack</dt>
      <dd>
        This is the most common type of stack used in desktop web applications.
        It consists of both frontend and backend technologies—for example,
        Angular for the UI, a framework like Django for the application logic,
        and a database like MongoDB for managing data.
      </dd>
      <dt style="font-weight: 800">Programming Language</dt>
      <dd>
        Programming languages take care of the important business logic that
        your applications need. Some top programming languages are JavaScript,
        TypeScript, Java, Python, Ruby, Scala, PHP, and C#.
      </dd>
      <dt style="font-weight: 800">FrameWorks</dt>
      <dd>
        Frameworks provide a structure to the application and have common
        utilities so that you don’t have to write every piece of logic from
        scratch. Some popular web frameworks are Express, Spring, Django,
        Laravel, Rails, and .NET.
